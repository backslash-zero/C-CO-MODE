# Celestin's Color Model (C-CO-MODE)

## Goal
Generating a full color palette from a single color. This project is mainly aimed at supporting IDE Themes generation. 

## How does it work
# Shades of the same color
By applying successive percentages of black and white we can achieve different tones.

# Accent colors
Through different models we can exract colors that will contrast well.
